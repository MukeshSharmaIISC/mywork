After a thorough review of available resources, I can provide the following insights into the `PyDebugValue` class used in PyCharm's debugger:

---

### 1. Retrieving Variable Name, Value, and Type

The `PyDebugValue` class is part of PyCharm's internal debugger engine, which is based on the open-source `pydevd` debugger. While the exact method names within `PyDebugValue` are not publicly documented, PyCharm's debugger provides functionality to inspect variables through the Variables pane in the Threads & Variables tab. This pane displays all data within the current scope, including method parameters, local variables, and instance variables. You can interact with these variables by right-clicking to evaluate expressions, add them to watches, or inspect their values and types.&#x20;

### 2. Representation of Python Collections and Objects

PyCharm's debugger represents Python collections and objects by evaluating their `__repr__` or `__str__` methods. For custom objects, you can customize how they are displayed in the debugger by modifying these methods. Additionally, PyCharm allows you to configure type renderers to customize how specific types are displayed in the debugger's Variables pane.&#x20;

### 3. Handling Exceptions During Debugging

PyCharm's debugger can be configured to break on exceptions. You can set it to break on all exceptions or only on unhandled exceptions. This is useful for catching exceptions that may not be explicitly handled in the code, allowing you to inspect the state of the program at the point of failure. ([JetBrains][1])

For more detailed information or specific use cases, you may need to refer to the source code of the `pydevd` library or explore the debugger's API through PyCharm's plugin development resources.
